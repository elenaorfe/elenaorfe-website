			<p className="mb-4 hyphens-auto text-justify">
				I&apos;m seeking a job change as I&apos;ll be relocating to the
				Netherlands (UTC+1) in the upcoming months. As a European citizen, I can
				move and work as a self-employed without needing company sponsorship, so
				there&apos;s no need to worry about that ðŸ˜‰

			<p className="mb-4 hyphens-auto text-justify">
				I want to work in a product-oriented company where I can take
				<span className="text-persian-green-500"> ownership </span>
				and contribute to its growth through meaningful products. After getting
				to know TailwindCSS and read the RefactoringUI book some years ago,
				working with you would be a dream come true!

			<p className="mb-4 hyphens-auto text-justify">
				I believe I would be a valuable addition to the team as I am motivated
				by<span className="text-persian-green-500"> challenges</span>,
				<span className="text-persian-green-500"> committed </span>and
				<span className="text-persian-green-500"> proactive</span>. I&apos;ve
				been lucky to work with awesome people, some of them have shared their
