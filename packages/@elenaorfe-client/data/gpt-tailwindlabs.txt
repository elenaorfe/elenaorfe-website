## Open source contributions

I have an enourmous respect about open source projects because they provide a lot of value to the community. I haven't contribute to any open source project so far, but I would love to contribute to as part of Tailwind team.
I have some public repositories in my GitHub account, where I share some of my personal projects and experiments. I am looking forward to contributing to open source projects in the future, as I believe in the power of collaboration and community-driven initiatives to foster innovation and growth in the tech industry.
Also I wrote an article in Medium about a Angular migration project that I did, where I shared my experience and some tips for a successful migration. This is the link: https://medium.com/@elenaorfe/migrate-angularjs-to-angular-through-angular-cli-hybrid-application-8790b272a1d7

## Code contributions for my team

I'm totally into automation, letting machines handle the repetitive stuff to free up our time. Lately, I've noticed a common hiccup in my current project: developers would push code, open the merge request, and only realize after the pipeline fails that tests weren't passing. Also untidy code formatting was a real eyesore for me while reviewing pull requests.
Due to the size of our team and our workflow, which generates a high volume of daily builds, we were incurring significantly higher costs than necessary.
I was aware of pre-commit hooks, but I wanted a solution that ensured developers couldn't skip running the Unit Tests and Prettier checks before committing. That's when I got to know Husky and gave it a shot. I was absolutely amazed at how well it fit the purpose! In fact, I liked it so much that I even set it up for my personal website.
